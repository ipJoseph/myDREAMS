## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Category Mapping

| FUB Category | FUB Count | DREAMS Equivalent | DREAMS Count | Gap |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-----|
| Hot | 14 | Heat ≥70 | 20 | +6 in DREAMS |
| Warm | 9 | Heat 40-69 | 18 | +9 in DREAMS |
| Cool | 1 | Heat 10-39 | 132 | +131 in DREAMS |
| New Leads | ~5-10 | Stage=Lead, <7 days | ~10 | Similar |
| Unresponsive | 2 | Relationship <20 | ~50+ | Gap! |

### Key Observations

1. **DREAMS identifies more "Hot" leads** (20 vs 14)
   - FUB Hot list may be manually maintained
   - DREAMS auto-calculates based on IDX activity (property views, saves, searches)

2. **Massive gap in "Cool" leads** (1 vs 132)
   - FUB likely requires manual tagging to add to Cool list
   - DREAMS automatically scores based on activity decay

3. **Unresponsive is under-identified in FUB** (2 vs ~50)
   - Many leads with low relationship scores (no communication) not tagged

## Outliers & Action Items

### 1. Hot Leads NOT in FUB Hot List
These leads have Heat ≥70 in DREAMS but may not be tagged "Hot" in FUB:

- **Barbara O'Hara** - Heat 100, active TODAY, still Stage=Lead
- **Lisa Johannes** - Heat 100, Stage=Lead, no phone contact logged
- **Donna Yarbrough** - Heat 100, Nurture, relationship score 0

### 2. Potential "Going Cold" (Heat Dropping)
Leads with high heat but no recent communication:

- **Jim Needell** - Heat 100 but last activity Jan 14 (21 days ago)
- **Todd Jensen** - Heat 100 but last activity Jan 13 (22 days ago)
- **William Habich** - Heat 76.5, last activity Jan 13

### 3. Unresponsive Candidates
Leads with low relationship score (<20) who may be unresponsive:

- **Lisa Johannes** - Priority 59.8, Relationship 0
- **Donna Yarbrough** - Priority 54.2, Relationship 0
- **Laura DeFranco** - Priority 49.8, Relationship 13.3

### 4. Missing Timeframes
The "Timeframe Empty" smartlist targets leads without a purchase timeline. In DREAMS, this corresponds to leads without intake forms or urgency field.

**Recommendation:** Cross-reference FUB "Timeframe Empty" with DREAMS leads missing intake forms.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Sync Hot List:** Add the 6 additional hot leads from DREAMS to FUB's Hot smartlist
2. **Call New Leads:** 10 new leads from past week need intake calls
3. **Re-engage Going Cold:** Jim Needell, Todd Jensen, William Habich haven't been contacted in 20+ days despite high heat
4. **Build Relationship:** Lisa Johannes, Donna Yarbrough have high heat but zero relationship score - need outreach

### System Improvements

1. **Auto-sync Heat Tiers:** Push DREAMS heat scores to FUB tags automatically
2. **Intake Form Tracking:** Create FUB custom field "Has Requirements" synced from DREAMS
3. **Unified Call List:** Replace manual FUB smartlists with DREAMS-powered priority list
