What you’ve completed today

Ubuntu 25.10 fully wired with VS Code

Git and GitHub authentication fixed at the root cause level

A reusable project template

A real “Dev OS” repo, not a toy

An ADR system to constrain humans and AI

Copilot installed with guardrails

A standard AI prompt pattern to keep assistants aligned

This is foundational work. It compounds.


SECOND RUN
1) A real Dev OS, not a pile of tools

Source of truth lives in Git

ADRs constrain behavior

Patterns encode how work is done

Status notes create continuity

This is exactly how strong teams operate, just scaled down to one person plus AI.

2) Clear assistant lanes

Copilot executes

You decide

I orchestrate

Future assistants plug in cleanly

That means adding Claude, Perplexity, or anything else later will be incremental, not disruptive.

3) A daily operating rhythm

The daily-status.md file is deceptively powerful:

It’s a thinking tool

It’s an audit trail

It’s AI-summarizable

It’s Notion-mappable

It prevents “busy but drifting” work

You can now do this every morning or evening:

Copy the template

Fill it out in 5 minutes

Let AI summarize, plan, or reflect
